Common API Error Messages

If you're encountering issues with our API, this guide will help you understand some common error messages and their meanings.

Please note: This list is not comprehensive. Other errors involving the dynamics of generic EVM transaction estimations might require deeper investigation.

General Errors

400 - Bad Request: This indicates an incorrect parameter. Ensure that all required parameters are correctly set.

403 - Forbidden: This indicates that the origin address is a banned or restricted address (see terms and conditions)

403 - Unauthorized: Your API key is missing or incomplete. Please double check that correct key was entered and try again.

429 - Rate Limit: You've made too many requests to the API within a 1 second time period. Reduce your requests per second (RPS) to stay below the free 1rps limit. If higher limits are required, please fill out the 1inch Network Enterprise API application.

503 - Banned IP: The IP address you're using to access the API is banned. Please ensure you're adhering to 1inch Network's terms of use.

The API isn't behaving as expected: In certain cases you may be passing in a parameter supported by the API but the wrong type or expected value. For example disableEstimate=true will work but disableEstimate=True will not. All parameters are CAsE SenSiTive. This is especially apparent when stringifying boolean values in python.

Specific Errors

Cannot sync token: The token either doesn't exist on the blockchain or isn't a valid token. Also, double check that you are using the correct chainID in relation to the token used.

Amount is not set: The 'amount' field hasn't been specified.

Please note: All token amounts must be in the correct decimal format! The decimal format can be found by looking up the token contract on the block explorer.
Example: If the source token is DAI, and you are sending 1 DAI, the amount with 18 decimals would be 1000000000000000000.

Src is not set: The 'src' (source token contract) field is missing.

Dst is not set: The 'dst' (destination token contract) field is missing.

Insufficient liquidity: The aggregator can't find a route for the swap due to low liquidity.

Swap-specific Errors

Not enough src balance: This means your source token balance is insufficient. It provides the required amount and your current balance.

Not enough Allowance: You haven't granted the necessary token allowance to the 1inch router. It'll indicate the amount, current allowance, and the spender address, e.g., "Spender: 0x1111111254eeb25477b68fb85ed929f73a960582".

Insufficient liquidity: As mentioned earlier, the aggregator couldn't route the swap.

INFO

If you are an enterprise with significant API request volumes, please complete this application so we can assign you a custom API endpoint. The enterprise endpoint will offer significantly better performance across market rates and response times.
