    bytes calldata permit
) external returns(uint256 returnAmount)


Swaps amount of the specified token for another token using Unoswap-compatible exchange's pool, with a minimum return specified by minReturn and permit-based approval.

Parameters:

See {IUniswapV3SwapCallback-uniswapV3SwapCallback} Called by UniswapV3 pool during the swap operation initiated by UnoswapRouter's methods with UniswapV3. This callback function ensures the proper transfer of tokens based on the swap's configuration. It handles the transfer of tokens by either directly transferring the tokens from the payer to the recipient, or by using a secondary permit contract to transfer the tokens if required by the pool. It verifies the correct pool is calling the function and uses inline assembly for efficient execution and to access low-level EVM features.
