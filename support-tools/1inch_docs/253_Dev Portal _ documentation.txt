Resolver verification

Prior to registering as a resolver, each individual or company is required to pass a verification procedure.

The aim of the verification is to provide a safe and transparent environment within the 1inch Network. Verification ensures that each resolver is a trustworthy actor within the network, increasing user confidence and trust. Additionally, verification is necessary for the resolver to receive relevant rewards.

Essentially, verification involves completing an identifying KYC (know-your-client)/KYB (know-your-business process) questionnaire. The process is slightly different for individuals and entities, but in both cases it is straightforward. It involves answering several questions and uploading basic identification documents.
