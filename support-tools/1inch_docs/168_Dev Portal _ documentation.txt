Building a Simple dApp using the 1inch Web3 RPC API

In this tutorial, we will build a simple decentralized application (dApp) that checks the Ethereum balance of any EVM-compatible wallet address. We'll be using the 1inch Web3 RPC API along with the web3.js library to interact with the blockchain.

Prerequisites:
Node.js installed on your machine. Download it here.
Web3 library. Install it using npm install web3.

Details:

Endpoint: https://api.1inch.dev/web3/1
Method: POST
Parameters:
RPC-specific parameters: jsonrpc, method, params, and id.
Step 1: Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in your project directory and add the following lines. Be sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY and YOUR_0x_WALLET_ADDRESS with your actual 1inch API key and wallet address. You can obtain an API key here.

API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY;
WALLET_ADDRESS=YOUR_0x_WALLET_ADDRESS;
CHAIN_ID=1;

Step 2: Building the Balance Checker

Create a new file named balance_checker.js and write the following code:

Step 3: Running the Balance Checker

Save the script and run it using the command:

node balance_checker.js


The script will then fetch and display the balance for the designated wallet address.

That's it! You've just built a simple balance checker using the 1inch Web3 RPC API. This basic app can serve as a foundation for more complex dApp projects, such as creating functions to check additional token balances or incorporating new features (like swaps) available through the other available 1inch APIs.
