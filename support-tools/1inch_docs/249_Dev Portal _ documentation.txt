How to implement 1inch wallet auto-connect

Web3 browser in 1inch Wallet injects JavaScript code/objects when opening a webpage.

So first it is necessary to find out if the provider has been injected:

export function isOneInchWalletProviderInjected(): boolean {
  return Boolean(
    ethereum?.isOneInchIOSWallet || ethereum?.isOneInchAndroidWallet,
  );
}


The next step is to retrieve the net/address, thus it would be classified as a connection.

// Retrieving accounts: eth_requestAccounts returns the current one, it gives an array containing single address
const accounts = await ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });

// returns id of the network in hex-format
const currentChain = await ethereum.request({ method: "eth_chainId" });
