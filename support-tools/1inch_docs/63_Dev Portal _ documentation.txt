Introduction

1inch Orderbook API is using the 1inch Limit Order Protocol, which is a set of smart contracts that can work on any EVM-based blockchains. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.

Orderbook

Orderbook is a financial instrument with which you can put up an ERC-20 token for sale at a fixed price.
For example, you can put up 2 WBTC tokens for sale at the price of 82,415 DAI tokens.

1inch Limit Orders Protocol has many tools for flexible trade management:

Partial fill
Predicates
Single cancellation
Bunch cancellation
Fullness check
Validation

To enable efficient market making, RFQ orders are used, benefiting from a special optimization that avoids high gas costs during execution.

Limit order execution
1. Order placement

Users place limit orders via the 1inch dApp. Each order is cryptographically signed and remains off-chain until executed.

2. Order discovery

Anyone can fetch these signed orders using the 1inch Orderbook API to execute trades by submitting them on-chain.

3. Order execution

To execute an order, the signed order is submitted to the smart contract's fillOrder method. See the latest contract addresses in Limit Order SDK.

INFO

Both the buyer and seller must approve the 1inch Limit Order Protocol to transfer their tokens.

Supported tokens standards
ERC-20
ERC-721
ERC-1155

Other token standards can be supported via external extensions.
