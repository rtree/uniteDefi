Infrastructure Fees

Infrastructure fees apply to all prepaid plans, exclusively for Classic Swap API transactions. These fees are deducted from the destination amount of each completed Network Request and are distinct from subscription fees. They help maintain and scale the infrastructure that powers the APIs—ensuring reliability, performance, and operational continuity.

Following infrastructure fees apply by plan:

Plan	Fees for stable coins	Fees for non-stable coins
Dev	10bps	30 bps
Startup	7bps	20 bps
Pro	4 bps	10 bps
Business	2 bps	5 bps
