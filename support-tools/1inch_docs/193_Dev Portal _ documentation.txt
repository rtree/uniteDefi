Functions
constructor
function constructor(
    contract IWETH weth
)

Parameters:
Name	Type	Description
weth	contract IWETH	
rescueFunds
function rescueFunds(
  contract IERC20 token,
  uint256 amount
) external


Retrieves funds accidently sent directly to the contract address.

Parameters:
Name	Type	Description
token	contract IERC20	ERC20 token to retrieve
amount	uint256	amount to retrieve
destroy
function destroy(
) external


Destroys the contract and sends eth to sender. Use with caution. The only case when the use of the method is justified is if there is an exploit found. And the damage from the exploit is greater than from just an urgent contract change.

Events
Swapped

  address sender,
  contract IERC20 srcToken,
  contract IERC20 dstToken,
  address dstReceiver,
  uint256 spentAmount,
  uint256 returnAmount
)

Parameters:
Name	Type	Description
sender	address	
srcToken	contract IERC20	
dstToken	contract IERC20	
dstReceiver	address	
spentAmount	uint256	
returnAmount	uint256
