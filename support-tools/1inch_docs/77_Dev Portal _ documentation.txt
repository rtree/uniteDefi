Advanced usage for custom protocol integration

The limit-order-sdk can be used not only to integrate with the 1inch Orderbook, but also as a toolkit for building custom trading infrastructure based on the 1inch Limit Order Protocol.

This approach is intended for teams who want full control over how orders are constructed, signed, and filled—independently of the public 1inch backend.

With this scenario, you can benefit from using the following advanced features:

Manually construct limit and RFQ orders
Asset evaluation helpers
Custom execution predicates
Difference between Orderbook API and custom protocol
Feature	Orderbook API	Custom Protocol Integration
Limit orders	✅ Supported	✅ Supported
permit field	✅ Supported	✅ Supported
RFQ orders	❌ Not supported	✅ Fully supported
Custom predicates	❌ Ignored	✅ Executed on-chain
interaction field	❌ Not accepted	✅ Fully usable
Fee customization	❌ Fixed (protocol default)	✅ Fully configurable
About RFQ orders

A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is a business process where a trader requests a price quote from a supplier for the purchase of specific tokens. RFQ orders are gas-optimized and purpose-built for the needs of professional market makers. They offer lightweight execution with specific constraints:

Supports expiration time
Can be canceled by order ID
Fillable only once
Allows partial fill (only once)

These characteristics make RFQ orders ideal for real-time, short-lived liquidity provisioning.
