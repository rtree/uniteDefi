What are transaction traces?

A transaction trace is essentially a step-by-step representation of every operation that occurs during the execution of a transaction on the blockchain. For Ethereum, these operations can be quite varied, from basic transfers of ETH to complex contract interactions.

Why are transaction traces useful?
Debugging smart contracts: developers can use transaction traces to troubleshoot their smart contracts, especially when something goes wrong. They can identify which specific step of the contract resulted in an error.
Optimization: developers can analyze how gas is consumed during different operations in the transaction. This helps in optimizing smart contracts to be more gas efficient.
Security audits: transaction traces can be instrumental in security audits. They allow auditors to see the exact flow of operations, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected.
Understanding contract behavior: for those trying to understand how a particular smart contract operates, tracing provides a clear breakdown of its inner workings.
Historical analysis: for platforms or researchers analyzing blockchain data, transaction traces offer rich insights into the actual execution of historical transactions.
