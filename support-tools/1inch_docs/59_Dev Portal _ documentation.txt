Generate data for calling the 1inch router for swapping: /api/swap
Description of query parameters

All parameters with asterisks "*" are REQUIRED

Parameter name	Type	Description
src *	string	contract address of a token to sell
e.g.: 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f
dst *	string	contract address of a token to buy
e.g.: 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48
amount *	integer	amount of a token to sell, set in minimal divisible units e.g.:
1.00 DAI set as 1000000000000000000
51.03 USDC set as 51030000
from *	string	address of a seller, make sure that this address has approved to spend src in needed amount
e.g.: 0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5
origin *	string	The EOA address which initiates the transaction (for compliance KYC/AML)
slippage *	number	limit of price slippage you are willing to accept in percentage, may be set with decimals. &slippage=0.5 means 0.5% slippage is acceptable. Low values increase chances that transaction will fail, high values increase chances of front running. Set values in the range from 0 to 50
protocols	string	specify liquidity protocols. If not set, all liquidity protocols will be used; you can disable any protocol by listing all protocols except those you don't need
e.g.: &protocols=WETH,CURVE,BALANCER,...,ZRX
default: all protocols can be used
receiver	string	recipient address of a purchased token
if not set, from will receive a purchased token
includeTokensInfo	boolean	if set to true, response will include from token and to token info
default: false
includeProtocols	boolean	if set to true, response will include protocols used in the quote
default: false
referrer	string	referrer's address
fee	number	this percentage of src token amount will be sent to referrer, the rest will be used as input for a swap
min: 0; max: 3; default: 0
example to set a fee to 1.5%: &fee=1.5
gasPrice	string	1inch takes in account gas expenses to determine exchange route. It is important to use the same gas price on the quote and swap methods.
Gas price set in wei: 12.5 GWEI set as 12500000000
default: "fast" from network
permit	string	https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612
compatibility	boolean	This will exclude the Unoswap method, allowing for trading of fee on transfer (FoT) assets.
default: false
excludedProtocols	string	Liquidity source names (not addresses) listed here will be excluded from the 1inch router, and will not be included in the swap path.
default: none
complexityLevel	string	maximum number of token-connectors to be used in a transaction. The more is used — the longer route estimation will take, the more complex route might be as a result. If not set, two token-connectors may be used
min: 0; max: 3; default: 2
connectorTokens	string	token-connectors can be specified via this parameter. The more is set — the longer route estimation will take. If not set, default token-connectors will be used. If a token you want to exchange doesn't have a pool with one of the default token-connectors this parameter will help find the route; should be the same for a quote and swap max: 5;
e.g.: &connectorTokens=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f
default: list of default token-connectors
allowPartialFill	boolean	if true, the algorithm can cancel part of the route, if the rate has become less attractive. Unswapped tokens will return to the from
default: true
disableEstimate	boolean	if true, disable most of the checks
default: false
gasLimit	integer	maximum amount of gas for a swap;
should be the same for a quote and swap
default: 11500000; max: 11500000
mainRouteParts	integer	limit maximum number of main route parts;
should be the same for a quote and swap
default: 20; max: 50
parts	integer	limit maximum number of parts each main route parts can be split into; should be the same for a quote and swap
default: 20; max: 100
usePermit2	boolean	if true, use Permit2 for approval
Description of response parameters
By default only toAmount and the tx object are returned
Parameter name	Type	Description
srcToken	string	parameters of a token to sell
dstToken	string	parameters of a token to buy
fromAmount	string	input amount of srcToken in minimal divisible units
dstAmount	string	result amount of dstToken in minimal divisible units
protocols	string	route of the trade
from	string	transactions will be sent from this address
to	string	transactions will be sent to our contract address
data	string	bytes of call data
value	string	amount of ETH (in wei) will be sent to the contract address
gasPrice	string	gas price in wei
gas	string	estimated amount of the gas limit, increase this value by 25%
