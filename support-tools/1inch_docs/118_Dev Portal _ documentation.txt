Building a Token Balance Checker using 1inch Balance API

In this tutorial, we will create a simple Python script to check the token balances of a given wallet address using the 1inch Balance API. We'll use the popular requests library to make API calls.

Prerequisites:
Python (3.6 or higher) installed on your machine.
requests library. Install it using pip install requests.
Step 1: Understanding the API

Before we begin, let's briefly understand the 1inch Balance API endpoint we'll be using:

Endpoint: https://api.1inch.dev/balance
Method: GET
Parameters:
walletAddress: The Ethereum wallet address for which we want to fetch token balances.
Step 2: Implementing the Token Balance Checker

Create a new Python file named token_balance_checker.py and write the following code:

# token_balance_checker.py
import requests

def get_token_balances(wallet_address):
    endpoint = f'https://api.1inch.dev/balance/v1.2/1/balances/{wallet_address}'
    response = requests.get(endpoint, headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer YOUR-API-KEY'})

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch token balances. Error code: {response.status_code}")
        return None

def main():
    # Replace '0xYourWalletAddress' with the Ethereum wallet address you want to check
    wallet_address = '0xYourWalletAddress'
    token_balances = get_token_balances(wallet_address)

    if token_balances:
        print(f"Token balances for wallet address {wallet_address}:")
        for token, balance in token_balances.items():
            print(f"{token}: {balance}")
    else:
        print("Token balance fetch failed. Please check your wallet address.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Step 3: Running the Token Balance Checker

Save the script and run it using the command:

python token_balance_checker.py


Replace '0xYourWalletAddress' in the script with the Ethereum wallet address you want to check. The script will then fetch and display the token balances for that wallet address.

That's it! You have now built a simple Token Balance Checker using the 1inch Balance API. You can further expand this project to include more functionality, such as calculating the total value of tokens based on token prices, filtering out zero-balance tokens, and more.

Remember to handle errors and implement security measures, such as input validation and user authentication, when building real-world applications.
